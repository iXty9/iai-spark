# Application Architecture Documentation

## Overview
This application is a React-based chat interface with comprehensive debug tooling and state management optimized for both development and production environments.

## Core Architecture Decisions

### 1. Debug System Architecture
- **Production Optimization**: Debug code is completely tree-shaken in production builds
- **Development Features**: Comprehensive state tracking, event logging, and performance monitoring
- **Zero-Cost Abstraction**: Debug utilities have no runtime cost in production

### 2. State Management Pattern
- **Hook-based Architecture**: Custom hooks for specific concerns (submit state, message state, retry logic)
- **Performance Optimized**: Proper memoization and callback optimization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Local State First**: Uses React's built-in state management with localStorage persistence

### 3. Message Processing Flow
```
User Input -> useSubmitState -> processMessage -> API Call -> Response Processing -> UI Update
                     |                                              |
              Retry Logic (useMessageRetry)            Debug Events & Logging
```

### 4. Test Coverage Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Core hooks and utilities
- **Integration Tests**: Message processing flow
- **Performance Tests**: Debug system overhead
- **Coverage Target**: 70% minimum across all metrics

## Key Components

### Debug System (`src/utils/debug-events.ts`)
- Event deduplication and throttling
- Tab visibility detection
- Memory-efficient event tracking
- Production no-op implementation

### Message State Management (`src/hooks/chat/use-message-state.ts`)
- Persistent chat history
- Optimized re-render prevention
- State synchronization with localStorage

### Retry Logic (`src/hooks/chat/use-message-retry.ts`)
- Exponential backoff strategy
- Maximum retry limits
- Error type detection (abort vs network errors)

## Performance Considerations

### Bundle Size Optimizations
- Tree-shaking for debug code
- Lazy loading of non-critical components
- Optimized dependency imports

### Runtime Performance
- Memoized callbacks and computed values
- Event handler optimization
- Efficient cleanup patterns

### Memory Management
- Automatic cleanup of debug event history
- Weak references where appropriate
- Interval management for background tasks

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Individual hook behavior
- Utility function correctness
- Edge case handling

### Integration Tests
- Message flow end-to-end
- State synchronization
- Error boundary behavior

### Performance Tests
- Bundle size regression tests
- Runtime performance benchmarks
- Memory leak detection

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features
1. Consider production impact first
2. Add comprehensive tests
3. Document performance implications
4. Use TypeScript strict mode

### Debug Tooling
1. All debug code must be production-safe
2. Use conditional compilation for dev-only features
3. Implement proper cleanup patterns
4. Maintain event deduplication

### State Management
1. Use memoization for expensive computations
2. Implement proper cleanup in useEffect
3. Minimize re-render surface area
4. Keep state as local as possible

## Known Limitations

### Current Constraints
- Debug panel only available in development
- Local storage size limits for chat history
- Browser compatibility for advanced features

### Future Improvements
- Server-side state synchronization
- Advanced debug data export
- Performance profiling integration
- Automated test coverage reporting

## Maintenance Notes

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor bundle size changes
- Review test coverage reports
- Update dependency versions
- Performance benchmark comparisons

### Code Health Indicators
- Test coverage above 70%
- Bundle size under defined limits
- No memory leaks in debug tools
- Clean console in production builds
